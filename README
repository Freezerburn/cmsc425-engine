====================================================
Instructions:
    Movement:
        All movement instructions are relative to the camera
        W - Move forward
        S - Move backward
        A - Move left (doesn't turn)
        D - Move right (doesn't turn)
        Space - Flies up (disables gravity while held)
        Shift - Flies down (disables gravity while held)
        2 - Temporarily disables gravity until space/shift are pressed
    Camera:
        1 - Grabs mouse (allows you to look around, not grabbed by default)
        E - Switch between first and third person views
        Mouse - Look around
    Lighting:
        P - Light position 1 (default)
        O - Light position 2 (overhead)
        I - Light position 3 (opposite of 1)

        Z - Shader color 1 (full white, default)
        X - Shader color 2 (neon green)
        C - Shader color 3 (purple/magenta)
        V - Shader color 4 (orange)
    Quit:
        Q, Esc - Closes application
        Can also close with the standard "X" that is part of the window

----------------------------------------------------
Known Bugs:
    When the mouse is moved too fast, the camera rotation can start to get
        a bit strange. Can only fix this by re-starting the application.
    When the mouse is moved too fast in third-person mode, Tommy can de-sync
        from the camera rotation and face a different way than the camera.
        Going to first person and then back to third fixes this.
    Collision detection isn't set properly in third person mode, so Tommy
        tends to clip through things.
    Textures aren't correctly applied to the four pillars, so the tree texture
        goes in random directions and doesn't look particularly good. I left
        this alone because it was less important than getting everything else
        working.
    Normals are static and never dynamically calculated, so when Tommy is moved
        around in third person mode the lighting on him never changes.
    The shader for lighting is technically incomplete. It only calculates the
        diffuse (and technically it should also include ambient) lighting.
        This is only 1 (or 2) part(s) of standard Phong shading. The specular
        portion is not calculated. It is also highly simplistic and purely
        dependant upon angle of incidence between the light and surface.

----------------------------------------------------
Building:
    Same as the last project, dump all of the source files into your favorite Java IDE of choice
        and add the LWJGL libraries following:
        http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Eclipse
        for example.
        (http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page has the list of all IDEs)
        Then you just need to tell the IDE to build and run the program, using:
        src.game.Project1
        as the main class.
    Please note that this project requires at least OpenGL 3.2.

----------------------------------------------------
Lastly:
    If you have to look at my source code, I am truly sorry. I had the best of intentions when
        initially putting everything together, and then it turned into a massive glob of nasty
        code. At least it mostly works.
